### Mohammad Al-Jarrah 
I’m a Ph.D. Student in the department of aeronautics and aeronautics at University of Washington (UW) since January 2023. I received my master degree in 2020 from the same department. My current research focuses on developing a new algorithm to solve the nonlinear filtering problem. Our approach relies heavily on the theory of optimal transport and deep learning. My research goal is to establish a novel framework to enable making decision under uncertainty.

### Yuhang Mei
I am a first-year PhD student in Aeronautics and Astronautics Department at University of Washington advised by Prof. Amir Taghvaei. Besfore joining UW, I completed my master's in Mechanical Engineering and Electrical & Computer Engineering at University of Michigan advised by Prof. Necmiye Ozay. I obtained my Bachelor degree in Mechanical Engineering at Huazhong University of Science and Technology. My research focus on the intersection of machine learning and control.

### Michele Martino (co-advised)
I am a Ph.D. student in Applied Mathematics at the University of Washington from Rome, Italy. I received a B.S. Honors in Mathematics from the University of Rochester and I am currently working under the supervision of Professors Bamdad Hosseini and Amir Taghvaei on transport methods for conditional sampling. During the reminder of my Ph.D., I hope to deepen my research in the fascinating field of optimal transport and its many applications in machine learning, uncertainty quantification, and data science
