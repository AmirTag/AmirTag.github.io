**Workshop Topics and Goals:** This workshop arose out of the interest expressed by a group of
collaborators and former students of Professor Sean Meyn to celebrate Sean’s 60th birthday and
honor his long-lasting contributions to the field of stochastic systems, Markov processes,
networks, and control theory.
Professor Meyn has made fundamental contributions to the field of decision and control for over
30 years. He has led the way in establishing a comprehensive theory for the Lyapunov stability
of Markov processes and controlled Markov processes including its relationship to spectral
theory and large deviations. This work has had renewed applicability to communication
networks and resource allocation problems. Professor Meyn has pioneered the use of stochastic
approximation techniques for reinforcement learning and simulation. This work has had
significant impact in other fields as well, such as machine learning and economics. Through his
work in control, visualization and performance analysis of energy markets, and more recently in
decentralized control of distributed energy resources for the smart grid, he continues to have an
important impact on renewable energy and large-scale control of the grid.
Professor Meyn has received many awards for his research. He holds the Professor and Robert
C. Pittman Eminent Scholar Chair in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at
the University of Florida. At the University of Florida, he is the director of the Laboratory for
Cognition & Control and the director of the Florida Institute for Sustainable Energy. He has held
visiting positions at universities all over the world, including the Indian Institute of Science,
Bangalore during 1997-1998 where he was a Fulbright Research Scholar. During his sabbatical
in the 2006-2007 academic year he was a visiting professor at MIT and United Technologies
Research Center (UTRC). His award-winning 1993 monograph with Richard Tweedie, Markov
Chains and Stochastic Stability, has been cited thousands of times in journals from a range of
fields. For this book, Professor Meyn received the 1994 ORSA/TIMS Award for the best
research publication in Applied Probability. The latest version of the book is published in the
Cambridge Mathematical Library. For the past ten years his applied research has focused on
engineering, markets, and policy in energy systems. He regularly engages with industry,
government, and academic panels on these topics, and hosts an annual workshop at the
University of Florida.
This workshop will bring together several of Sean’s collaborators and former students to discuss
a broad range of contemporary topics in different areas of systems and control theory. All the
speakers in the workshop have profited from close interactions with Sean at some point in their
careers and this venue will provide them with an opportunity to share with others how this
experience has enriched them as researchers and educators. The main goal of these talks is to
inspire a future generation of research leaders to pursuework that promotes excellence and will
thus likely have a profound impact in the field.

The individual topics for speakers are listed below.

1. Professor Vivek Borkar. Stochastic approximation revisited: some new wine in old
bottle.
2. Professor Ana Busic. Dynamic matching: approximate optimality with bounded regret.3. Professor Peter E. Caines. Systems on Unbounded Networks and the Graphon Mean
Field Game Equations.
4. Professor Ken Duffy and Professor Muriel Medard will deliver a joint talk. The title of
their lecture is “Meyn Control.”

Events in Networks.

By a stroke of marvelous coincidence, Professor Meyn is a plenary speaker at the IEEE CDC
(2018). The proposed workshop in advance of Professor Meyn’s plenary lecture at the main
conference will be a perfect birthday present to recognize and honor the scholarly contributions
that he has made to the systems and controls community over the past three decades.

**Intended Audience:** All are welcome to join this celebration of Professor Meyn’s 60 th birthday.

**Schedule:** The workshop will consist of 2 morning sections and 2 afternoon sections, for a total
of 6 hours. The specific times for the sessions will be arranged in coordination with the
conference organizers.
