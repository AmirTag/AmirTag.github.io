### Research summary
My research interest lies at the intersection of control theory and machine learning. In particular, I have been working on problems that can be modelled as a control or optimization problem on the space of probability distributions, such as [nonlinear filtering](), [Bayesian inference](), and [learning a generative model](). The motivation is to design meaningful approximations that can be computed through efficient and scalable numerical algorithms.
