I am looking for graduate student interested to work in the intersection of control theory and machine learning. The research involves combination of mathematical analysis and coding. Send me an e-mail if you are interested. Students from A&A, EE, ME and related departments are welcome.

### Research summary
My research interest lies at the intersection of control theory and machine learning. In particular, I have been working on problems that can be modelled as a control or optimization problem on the space of probability distributions, such as [Optimal filtering and control](./research/#FPF), [sampling](./research/#SM), and [optimal mass transportation](./research/#OT). The motivation is to design meaningful approximations that can be computed through efficient and scalable numerical algorithms.
