I am Assistant Professor at the William E. Boeing Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, in the University of Washington, Seattle. 
Prior to coming to Seattle, I enjoyed two sunny years as Postdoctoral Scholar at the University of California Irvine in Prof. Tryphon Georgiouâ€™s research lab. I received my Ph.D. degree in Mechanical Science and Engineering and the M.S. degree in Mathematics from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. You can find me at Guggenheim Hall (GUG) 318B and reach out to me by [e-mail](<amirtag@uw.edu>).                  
You can find my up-to-date oublication list at my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=l96zhjwAAAAJ&hl=en).

### Research projects
- [Nonlinear filtering and optimal control](./research/#FPF)
- Machine learning ([computational optimal transport](./research/#OT), [sampling](./research/#SM))
- [Stochastic thermodynamics](./research/#Thermo)
<!--My research interest lies at the intersection of control theory and machine learning. In particular, I have been working on problems that can be modelled as a control or optimization problem on the space of probability distributions, such as [Optimal filtering and control](./research/#FPF), [sampling](./research/#SM), [optimal mass transportation](./research/#OT), and [stochastic thermodynamics](./research/#Thermo). The motivation is to design meaningful approximations that can be computed through efficient and scalable numerical algorithms. -->
